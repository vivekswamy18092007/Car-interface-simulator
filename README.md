 Supercar Vehicle Dynamics Simulator (Python + Pygame)

A real-time vehicle dynamics simulator written in Python, using Pygame for visualization.

This project models the longitudinal behavior of a high-performance supercar, focusing on how engine torque, gearing, traction, aerodynamics, and control systems interact over time.

It is not a racing game but rather a physics-first driving sandbox.
